# Elevate_Labs_Task2
1. Generate Summary Statistics
Used describe() and median() to compute statistics like mean, std, and median.

Helps in understanding feature distributions and spotting potential outliers.

2. Create Histograms and Boxplots
Plotted histograms to observe feature distributions.

Used boxplots to detect outliers and understand data spread.

3. Use Pairplot/Correlation Matrix
Created pairplot using Seaborn to visualize pairwise relationships.

Computed and visualized a correlation matrix using a heatmap.

4. Identify Patterns, Trends, Anomalies
Counted missing values per feature.

Identified outliers using the IQR method for age and fare.

5. Make Feature-Level Inferences
Correlated numeric features with the target survived.

Helped identify which features most influence survival likelihood.
